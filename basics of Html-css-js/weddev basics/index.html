      <p>Let's say you have a product, a portfolio, or just an idea you want to share with everyone on your <em>own</em>
        website. Before you publish it on the internet, you want to make it look attractive, professional, or at least
        <em>decent</em> to look at.
      </p>
      <p>What is the <a href="#content">first thing</a> you need to work on?</p>
    </section>

    <section id="content">
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>The purpose of <strong>design</strong> is to enhance the presentation of the content it's applied to. It might
        sound obvious, but content being the <strong>primary</strong> element of a website, it should not be established
        as an afterthought.</p>
      <p>Written content, like the paragraph you're currently reading, makes up for more than 90% of the Web. Styling
        this textual content will go a long way.</p>
      <p>Let's assume you've already finalized the content you want to publish and just created an empty
        <code>style.css</code> file, what is the <a href="#centering">first rule</a> you can write?
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="centering">
      <h2>Centering</h2>
      <p>Long lines of text can be hard to parse, and thus hard to <strong>read</strong>. Setting a limit of characters
        per line greatly enhances the readability and appeal of a wall of text.</p>
      <pre><span class="selector">body</span> {
<span class="attribute">margin</span>: <span class="number">0</span> auto;
<span class="attribute">max-width</span>: <span class="number">50</span><span class="unit">em</span>;
}</pre>
      <p>After styling the text <em>blocks</em>, what about styling the <a href="#font-family">text itself</a>?</p>

    </section>

    <section id="font-family">
      <h2>Font family</h2>
      <p>The browser's font defaults to <code>"Times"</code>, which can look unappealing (mostly because it is the
        "unstyled" font). Switching to a <strong>sans-serif</strong> font like <code>"Helvetica"</code> or
        <code>"Arial"</code> can vastly improve the look of your page.</p>
      <pre><span class="selector">body</span> {
<span class="attribute">font-family</span>: <span class="string">"Helvetica"</span>, <span class="string">"Arial"</span>, sans-serif;
}</pre>
      <p><em>If you want to stick with a serif font, try <code>"Georgia"</code>.</em></p>
      <p>While this makes the text more <em>appealing</em>, let's also make it <a href="#spacing">more readable</a>.</p>
